# Completed hands-on solutions for Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE Deepskilling
These are my solutions to the mandatory hands-on problems pertaining to each skill for every week.
- The week-wise folder for each skill is named as Week number_Skill name
- The sub-folders of the parent folder are named as HandsOn number_Name
- The HandsOn folders may have sub-folders for multiple exercises within the same folder (eg. HandsOn exercise no. 1 for HandsOn 1 can be named as HandsOn 1.1)
- For each folder of the hands-on, there are 2 folders
- - Code -> contains the code file
  - Output -> contains the output screenshot (which may be aided by output analysis doc file sometimes)
